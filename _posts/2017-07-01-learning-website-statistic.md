## What is the difference between a hit, a page view, a visit, and a visitor

+ **Hit** - A hit is any request to a web server. Each time a visitor downloads a page, clicks a hyperlink, views a graphic, or performs any other action on a web site, a call is made to the web server. The web server records each of these requests in a log file. These requests are commonly known as "hits," and the loading of a single web page can amount to many hits, due to all of the elements it contains.

+ **Page View** - A page view represents a hit to any file designated among the page file types. The most common examples are files ending in .html, .htm, .php, .asp, or .aspx.

+ **Visit** - A visit is a session of continuous activity where all hits are recorded in the log file for one visitor to a web site. The visit starts the moment of the first hit on the web site and continues until the session ends through inactivity. By default, if a visitor is inactive for 30 minutes or more during a session, the visit is terminated and a new visit begins when activity resumes.

+ **Visitor** - A visitor is a person who visits a web site. Visitors are generally tracked by either an IP address or a cookie, although other methods of "sessionizing" the data are possible. The stronger the session tracking method, the more accurate the visitor metrics will be. Authenticated User is a strong session tracking method because it is based on sessions where users are required to log into the web site, but IP/User Agent is a weak session tracking method because any number of users may be on subnets behind a certain IP address.

## Meaning of Hits, Visits, Page Views and Traffic Sources - Web Analytics Definitions

1. **Visit** - This is the one piece of information that you really want to know. A visit is one individual visitor who arrives at your web site and proceeds to browse. A visit counts all visitors, no matter how many times the same visitor may have been to your site.
2. **Unique Visit** - This is also called Visit by Cookie. A unique visit will tell you which visits from item 1 are visiting your site for the first time. The website can track this as unique by the IP address of the computer. *The number of unique visits will be far less that visits because a unique visit is only tracked if cookies are enabled on the visitors computer*

3. **Page View** - This is also called Impression.  Once a visitor arrives at your website, they will search around on a few more pages. On average, a visitor will look at about 2.5 pages. Each individual page a visitor views is tracked as a page view.

4. **Hits** - The real Black Sheep in the family. The average website owner thinks that a hit means a visit but it is very different (see item 1).  A Hit actually refers to the number of files downloaded on your site, this could include photos, graphics, etc. Picture the average web page, it has photos (each photo is a file and hence a hit) and lots of buttons (each button is a file and hence a hit). On average, each page will include 15 hits. *To give you an example -  Using the average statistics listed above, 1 Visit to an average web site will generate 3 Page Views and 45 Hits.*
5. **Traffic Sources** - How do visitors find your site
    - Direct Navigation (type URL in traffic, bookmarks, email links w/o tracking codes, etc.)
    - Referral Traffic (from links across the web, social media, in trackable email, promotion & branding campaign links)
    - Organic Search (queries that sent traffic from any major or minor web search engines)
    - PPC (click through from Pay Per click sponsored ads, triggered by targeted keyphrases)
