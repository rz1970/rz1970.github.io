## High-level overview of GPDB system architecture

![High-level overview of the Greenplum Database system architecture](/Users/Ryan/Boostnote/uploads/highlevel_arch.jpg)

GPDB:
+ software-only solution
+ Performance depends on the hardware on which it is installed

## Master

+ entry point
+ accept client connections
+ process the SQL commands that the system users issue
+ maintains the system **catalog**, not contain any user data
+ authenticate client connections
+ process incoming SQL commands
+ distribute the work load between segments
+ coordinate the results returned by each segment
+ present the final results to the client program
+ need a fast, dedicated CPU for data loading, connection handling, and query planing

## Standby

+ keep up to date by a transaction log replication process
+ only the system catalog tables need to be synchronized

## Segment

+ where data is stored and where most query processing occurs
+ each segment contains a distinct portion of the data
+ the number of segment instances per segment host is determined by the number of effective CPUs or CPU core. 
+ Performance testing will help decide the best number of segments for a chosen hardware platform.
+ mirror: group mirroring (default) or spread mirroring
+ GPDB performance will be as fast as the **slowest segment server** in the array.
+ **Note:** one primary segment instance (or primary/mirror pair if using mirroring) per CPU core.
+ each CPU is typically mapped to a logical disk.
+ RAID

## Interconnect

+ the networking layer of GPDB
+ use a standard 10 Gigabit Ethernet switching fabric
+ use **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** with flow control for interconnect traffic to send messages over the network
+ GPDB does the additional **packet verification** and **checking not performed** by UDP,
+ configuration parameter: *gp_interconnect_type*
+ Example Network Interface Architecture:

## ETL Hosts for Data Loading

+ gpfdist
+ speed: an average rate of about 350 MB/s for delimited text formatted files and 200 MB/s for CSV formatted files. 

## Greenplum Performance Monitoring

+ GPDB includes a dedicated system monitoring and management database, named **gpperfmon**, that administrators can install and enable.
+ be enabled, every 15 seconds, agent on each segment host collect query status and system metrics
+ Greenplum Command Center
